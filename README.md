## Internship Domain
Data Analytics

## Task
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Description
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a structured dataset to identify meaningful patterns, trends, and insights. The analysis includes data inspection, statistical summaries, and visualizations such as bar charts and correlation heatmaps to support data-driven decision-making.

## Project Structure
- **data/** – Contains the dataset used for analysis  
- **src/** – Contains the Python source code for EDA  
- **outputs/** – Contains generated visualizations and charts  

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
2. Navigate to the `src` folder
3. Run the script:

## Output
The `outputs/` folder contains visualization files generated during the EDA process, including subject-wise performance comparisons and correlation analysis heatmaps.
